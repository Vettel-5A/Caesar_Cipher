 Caesar cipher program to encode and decode messages.

 # How To Format Messages
 When sending an encoded message to someone, they should know the shift number to be able to decode the message. Suppose you want to send the encoded message "hello world" to someone. To send the message to someone, type the encoded message then add a comma and include the shift number after, like this:
    
    mjqqt btwqix, 5.
 
 Now, when this message is sent, the person will know the encoded message, as well as the shift number to decode it.
